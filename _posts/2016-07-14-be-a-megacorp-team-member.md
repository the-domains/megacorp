# Be a Megacorp team member

Want to be part of a new Trading card game brand? We are a small, passionate group of people who are trying to create a dream with a lean business methodology.

Megacorp Games is looking for:

**Artists**

Our art team is based largely in Indonesia, and we are operating on a full profit share with them. Allowing them a direct stake in the brand's success with a 20% share in every set released. If you would like to contribute please send us your work. We can possibly utilize existing works if you release the rights for us to use it in the game and for promotional purposes. 

**Convention and event volunteers**

We are blessed to have a horde of happy volunteers even when the game was in conceptual stage. And we will be happy to give some exclusive giveaways for your time! Our focus for Megacorp is a happy player community. If you also would like to become a judge just drop us a line.
