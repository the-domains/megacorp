# Why Megacorp

1. Finally: **An Exciting Science fiction setting **- most TCGs (Trading Card Games) are usually part of the Fantasy genre.**More interactive than other Trading Card titles** - players can use cards from the discard pile and even from opponents networks when card are vulnerable in an upside down "engaged" state.
2. **Simpler rules: **No hand maximum size, no "summon sickness" - cards can be activated to produce trait resources or attack immediately, all event cards are instant-speed. Makes it easier to focus on the action, and less on the rules.
3. **Dedicated resource side-deck**, plus every card produces trait resource, your primary business card is also the ultimate 'manafix'.
4. Resource cards also passively produce "cashflow" each turn without having to be manipulated.

# For Retailers

1. **Re-playability:** Being able to purchase your opponents engaged cards as well as from the top of their open market, allows duels with opponents a different experience every time, promoting variety of play styles.
2. **Multiple modality:** play as a tabletop boardgame and Deckbuilding game in addition to its principal TCG mode. Versatile enough to handle even 4v4 and 9v9 multiple player games!
3. **More skill, less luck: **Card advantage andbuilt-in search mechanisms are accessible from the very first game
