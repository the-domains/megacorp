[Finally: **An Exciting Science fiction setting **- most TCGs (Trading Card Games) are usually part of the Fantasy genre.][0][**More interactive than other Trading Card titles** - players can use cards from the discard pile and even from opponents networks when card are vulnerable in an upside down "engaged" state.][0]
2. [**Simpler rules: **No hand maximum size, no "summon sickness" - cards can be activated to produce trait resources or attack immediately, all event cards are instant-speed. Makes it easier to focus on the action, and less on the rules.][0]
3. [**Dedicated resource side-deck**, plus every card produces trait resource, your primary business card is also the ultimate 'manafix'. ][0]
4. [Resource cards also passively produce "cashflow" each turn without having to be manipulated.][0]
5. [**Re-playability:** Being able to purchase your opponents engaged cards as well as from the top of their open market, allows duels with opponents a different experience every time, promoting variety of play styles.][0]
6. [**Multiple modality:** play as a tabletop boardgame and Deckbuilding game in addition to its principal TCG mode. Versatile enough to handle even 4v4 and 9v9 multiple player games!][0]
7. [**More skill, less luck: **Card advantage and****built-in search mechanisms are accessible from the very first game][0]

[Hardcore CCG fans - this is the game you want to play.][0]
