USA, my 3 week trip to Hawaii for work has come to a close and i have to return to Singapore.</p><p>However, in the process of introducing Megacorp to avid TCG fans in America, i have met some truly passionate people. In doing so i have two observations:</p><p>American table top gamers are somewhat introverted, but playgroups are not insular: Each local shop has a distinct player group (or “playgroup”) identity which interacts with a greater community based on game titles. This made the task of approaching people about Megacorp easier once an individual within each group finds the game demo appealing.</p><p>The second observation was that the casual TCG players engaged in one game, while more serious or competitive players played several games. Many of the seasoned top players in LVLup con had two to three games under their belt. </p><p>What is actionable in regards to future Megacorp community development is to extend strong support to the shop communities at a "grassroots" level. This is not to take away from the retailers own efforts at community building and organised play, but to strengthen it. <br>Each playgroup sometimes has their own social media groups with personalised content: perhaps giving these groups access to a "playgroup kit" with digital artwork for them to tweak into facebook banners and profile pics will create better resonance with the brand. <br>Another loose idea is to implement a "play calendar". One factor that prevents communities from achieving critical mass is the fact that individual players have conflicting schedules. Even with IM and social media, sometimes friends look for each other in local shops but do not have formal plans. Magic the Gathering's top down approach by implementation of "Friday Night Magic" has become a staple so players can at least expect some friends to be present for casual play via the weekly tournaments. However my thoughts on this, is that retailers will face the same problem as nightclubs and bars: they essentially have to rely on higher attendees on weekends to make enough revenue to cover 7 days of rent. </p><p>So should we create some kind of calendar system? Its hard enough for people to use google calendar or ios calendar for work as it is. Building a third party, one purpose calendar app for instance will be a futile measure. And a negative experience will result from missed appointments. While this does become consistent with the business theme of Megacorp, a different approach is needed that does not put more work on the retailer or expect players to become more proactive. <br>What i am facinated with is the concept of an appearence fee. This is an incentive introduced by Magic to compensate top players at larger sanctioned events. What if this was extended down to the local shop community level? While a monetary fee for just showing up is ultimately unsustainable, and promo cards or exclusive gifts might be abused (a phenomenon not unknown in asia where some shops might hold onto exclusives and sell them in the secondary market as additional revenue), this leads me to the conclusion that existing methods in the market are not sufficiently engaging. Also, that a digital methodology must be applied to it being scalable and sustainable. </p><p>What i would propose is a simple web driven database, populated by webform. Smartphone penetration is ubiquitous in America (rather endearingly the only female playtester of Megacorp we had, sharon, only had a feature phone. But this is the exception not the norm) and perhaps whenever a player "checks in" to a megacorp community, that player has to be "seconded" by another player, a judge or the retailer. Enough check in activity per month would then entail a promo sent directly to player. Now, in order to anticipate potential abuse, the check in mechanism can be correlated to sales activity. We do not want players checking into megacorp for incentives but in fact playing another game. Uploading a photo could be another option, but this could be invasive. I think i got it... this should be a group goal. The shop community as a whole would require X check ins and Y sales to unlock increasingly attractive tiers of support. And this in turn can be further gamified, with achievements for individual active players. This way, the system also benefits distributors to monitor their communities and help underperforming retailers. <br>Looks like its time to board my flight. I sincerely hope my open source approach to building this game appeals to . </p><p>Until later, <br>M.
